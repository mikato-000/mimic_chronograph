Hello,

I made a replica of the screen of Acetech Chronograph using python and tkinter because im bored and sad.

Gladly that i use less chatgpt and more learning than my course specialist.
still need teachers.

atlease im glad that there's chatgpt that teach and youtuber rather than old programmer that use only books and less infomatino on the internet.
I cherish today but I wish I am not abuse it.

I hope my pathway is still good in the future.
